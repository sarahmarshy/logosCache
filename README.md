# logosCache
logosCache is a Google Chrome extension that helps you build your vocabulary! 

I find myself using Google to find word definitions a lot, but I have trouble remembering what words I have found. This extension will look at your Google search history to find words you have looked up. It looks for a keyword "define," followed by a word or phrase.
